      # EHLO/HELO is always legal, per the standard. On success
      # it always clears buffers and initiates a mail "transaction."
      # Which means that a MAIL FROM must follow.
      #
      # Per the standard, an EHLO/HELO or a RSET "initiates" an email
      # transaction. Thereafter, MAIL FROM must be received before
      # RCPT TO, before DATA. Not sure what this specific ordering
      # achieves semantically, but it does make it easier to
      # implement. We also support user-specified requirements for
      # STARTTLS and AUTH. We make it impossible to proceed to MAIL FROM
      # without fulfilling tls and/or auth, if the user specified either
      # or both as required. We need to check the extension standard
      # for auth to see if a credential is discarded after a RSET along
      # with all the rest of the state. We'll behave as if it is.
      # Now clearly, we can't discard tls after its been negotiated
      # without dropping the connection, so that flag doesn't get cleared.
